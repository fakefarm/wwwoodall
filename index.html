I used to explain my eclectic combination of skills as a 'CEO in training'.<a href="//www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Benjamin-Franklin-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486290735" title="Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography"> Benjamin Franklin</a> introduced me to the life of a Renaissance Man - a man of many interests. <br>The way I think of it is as three categories and their relationships known as corporate production of Art (systems), Business (profit), and Code (execution). My value add is as a translator between the separate, yet essential aspects of a modern day Enterprise.</p> <hr> <h2>Artful Systems</h2> <h3>Art<br> + Business<br> = Strategy</h3> <p>An exciting customer experience must be designed systematically. I take many plays out of <a href="//www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1448317932&sr=1-1&keywords=emyth" title=e-myth>e-myth</a>, <a href="//www.amazon.com/The-Experience-Economy-Theater-Business/dp/0875848192" title="experience economy">experience economy</a> and <a href="//www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1448317872&sr=1-1&keywords=whole+new+mind" title="a whole new mind">a whole new mind</a> to remain competitive in today's marketplace.</p> <hr> <h2>Profitable Business</h2> <h3>Business<br> + Code<br> = Profit</h3> <p>After my first business went insolvent I realized that ignoring accounting and finance in favor of sales and product design was not smart. This is when I decided to take the time and learn how to manage a sustainable business. I received a Masters in Finance andy applied my new education on a second business, which I sold in after four years and nearly $3M in sales with 3 employees. What we build must serve the customer's need to the end they are willing to pay enough that we make a positive net income on the transaction.</p> <hr> <h2>Clean Code</h2> <h3>Code<br> + Art<br> = Growth</h3> <p>Code must be presented in such a way that the user experience is so pleasant it creates raving fans who tell their friends about us. In 2007 I discovered <a href='//www.basecamp.com' target=_blank>basecamp</a>. It's simplicity, effectiveness, and business model fascinated me. It was the first web app that made me realize the web did not die when the <i>dot com</i> bubble burst. I started joking with my friends around that time that "I've recently come to the conclusion that the Internet was here to stay". Meaning, I knew how to consume the web but I didn't know how to produce it. Since 2009 I've learned what is actually possible.</p> <hr> <div class=rate-section> <h3 class=rate>$295 hour</h3> <p class=rate-text>I am currently available for 5 - 10 hours a week at $295 hour or full-time <br>(Boulder, Greenville SC, or Remote) <br>as a Javascript &amp; Rails Developer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <div id=contact></div> <br> <section class='contact module'> <h4>contact</h4> <ul> <li><a href="mailto:dave@woodalls.me">dave@woodalls.me</a></li> <li>303.416.7032</li> <li>Boulder, CO</li> <li class=''> <a class="fa fa-twitter" target=_blank href="//www.twitter.com/wwwoodall"></a> </li> </ul> </section> <div id=resume></div> <section class='module resume'> <h1>Resume</h1> <p>Capable of designing, coding, and implementing proposed plans</p> <div class=comment> <div class=comment-image> <img src="images/animores/turkey.jpg"/> </div> <div class=comment-content> <span id=living-social></span> <h1>Software Engineer <span class=company>Jan 2014 - Present</span></h2> <p class=comment-detail>livingSocial</p> <p>I've had the privilege to work on three entirely different teams. I was hired to handle some frontend work since my Rails skills. I was honest that I was really weak in two areas; javascript and TDD. I interviewed with @dhassler and @timschmelmer. Tim gave me a Russ Olsen Design Pattern quiz which, since I read the book, I told him I knew the answer. Had I not read the book, I would have been lost. But those guys were great and helped me learn a ton.</p> <h3>Escapes: Retail Vertical</h3> <div class=ls-examples> <p>Most of my work was frontend on Rails: HTML, ERB, Partials, CSS, and JavaScript.</p> <img src="images/escape.png"/> </div> <hr> <h3>Personalization: Data Science & UI</h3> <p>This was a very awkward position because it was opperating in Data Science on a Gem. We weren't even in Rails so I had to orient myself with code that had no familiar acheitechutre. ON top of that, Data Sciene use the words <span>test, engine, model</span> in very different ways. As part of this time I founded an Angular Club to try to apply what I was learning from some exploratory work we were doing. I was able to volunteer for Angular because Doug Ramsey called for ANgular's establishment in the LS eco system. That was before the 2.0 debacle. I had also invested about 1,000 hours with @cjgrimes on Angular so I figured I had to know more than the total beginners. That's when I met Eldar, Shauna, and Ian. Those guys are A+ talent and should be treated as such.</p> <h1>Urgency</h1> <div class=ls-examples> <p>we used this to entice people 10%. Much of my work on this project was in JavasScipt debugging and QA testing.</p> <img src="images/urgency.png"/> </div> <h1>Daily Gem</h1> <div class=ls-examples> <p>Yes, we actually hired Robin Leach <a href="https://vimeo.com/102170193">for this</a>. At the end of the experiment, we realized that people will buy more if the price is cheaper. The experiment was a success.</p> <a taget=_blank href="https://vimeo.com/102170193"><img src="images/robin.png"/></a> </div> <h1>Save For Later</h1> <div class=ls-examples> <p> The idea of save for later was to let people browse and save deals for later. It worked well on mobile but didn't translate to Desktop. This is a project that had nobody in the role because the lead Front End developer left. So, I volunteered and was way in over my head. Thanks to @shaun for bailing me out! </p> <img src="images/sponsor.png"/> </div> <hr> <h3>Internal Tools: Customer Service</h3> <div class=ls-examples> <p>Working in a tech company can make one forget that there are actual people being serviced from all the code we write. Working on internal tools, specifically for customer service reps means I get to learn first hand what our customer problems are and attempting to come up with solutions to empower customer service reps with the ability to create happy customer experiences.</p> <img src="images/q.svg"/> </div> <hr> <h3>Volunteer work</h3> <img src="images/five_year_plan.png"/> <p>In addition to helping with the code base, I was an active member of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Founder, Leader - Angular Club</li> <li>Facilitator - Lightning talks</li> <li>Author of <a target=_blank href="dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13563632/xls_draft.pdf">LivingSocial 2.0 - A vision for the future</a> </li> </ul> <hr> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p> Working with three different pilots and then speaking with our <i>Business to Consumer</i> customers gave me perspectives on what entices a customer but also how to solve buyer remorse. Some examples of lessons include: Broad understanding of what it takes to work on a massive code base, Increased understanding of micro services, Managing multiple apps at the same time, and a production level design work flows. </p> </div> </div> <hr>o <div class=comment> <div class=comment-image> <img src="images/animores/whale.jpg"/> </div> <div class=comment-content> <h1>Web Developer <span class=company>Feb 2014 - Present</span></h2> <p class=comment-detail>FakeFarm</p> <p>fake farm is a digital playground to record my practice as a developer, designer, and father.

Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, <i>HTML is the new English</i>.
