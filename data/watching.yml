        caption: "Tests are supposed to save us money. How is it, then, that many times they become millstones around our necks, gradually morphing into fragile, breakable things that raise the cost of change? We write too many tests and we test the wrong kinds of things. This talk strips away the veil and offers simple, practical guidelines for choosing what to test and how to test it. Finding the right testing balance isn't magic, it's a magic trick; come and learn the secret of writing stable tests that protect your application at the lowest possible cost."

        caption: "As Rails developers we depend on the network. But if you're new to web development, it's probably a mystery. That's a problem. Knowing how the network works is critical for fixing certain types of bugs and for diagnosing performance issues.<br> In this talk, we'll follow the lives of a TCP and an HTTP request, marvel as they pass through your browse, OS, router, web server and app serve. Finally, we'll discuss how this knowledge is used to fix common bugs and increase app performance."

        caption: "There is only one Commandment that prohibits a thought, and it is this: 'Do not covet.' Why does the Bible, which is preoccupied with behavior, legislate a thought? Because to covet, to want what belongs to someone else, is the root of the preceding four commandments and often leads to evil. Before someone murders, steals, lies, or commits adultery, the desire to take what is rightly someone else's usually comes first."
