#     body: "I have the privilege of pairing with <a href='http://www.twitter.com/tcopeland' target='_blank'>Tom Copeland</a> once a week. He's the winner of a <a href='http://rubyheroes.com/' target='_blank'>Ruby Hero Award</a> and a senior developer at LivingSocial. He's also a Christian so we get talk faith while the test suite runs."

#     body: "There is a rite of passage you must go through. It's the path of being a bad coder. The purpose of this time is to learn to become comfortable in ignorance and incompetence yet still prevail. Software will build your faith and resolve as you begin to see that time, patience, and determination will break through the unknown."
