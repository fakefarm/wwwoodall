Life after a death has taken me down some interesting thoughts about…everything. But I'm beginning to notice a common theme I'm learning of rejecting the kingdoms that war against His kingdom. </p> <p>It's a strange experience to stand on the soil of a cemetery where you've buried a child. Life has a way of removing it's perception of infinite life. When infinite life changes, so do other views that were based on that. Like pursuits of other things that were just as naive and youthful.</p> <p>What I've seen and believe at 37 is different when I was 27, 17, and 7. Each previous decade has held simpler and safer views of life. Almost sheltered. I used to live like I would live forever. Why not? I had strength and desire. But as those run out I seems to be ready to receive a different message. </p> <p>Recently I watched a clip that suggested the Illuminati created the monetary system. Illuminati, as in the group for humans controlled by the devil for the devil’s long term plan described in Revelation: One-world religion, One-world government, the anti-christ, 666, and others forthcoming prophesies Christians typically believe in. Topics that I would agree with but never leaned into the logistics and feasibilities. Up until this year, those were fringe topics I had <em>zero</em> interest in. I've been a very transactional Christian. </p> <p>But regardless of the inspiration, ever since I heard that the money system is not of God I’ve begun thinking through what it would mean to reject my acceptance of the entire monetary system that rules our life and thoughts. I'm wondering if I can accept it the same way I live with gay marriage and abortion. As in part of this world but not choices I agree with.</p> <p><em>No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Matthew 6:24</em></p> <p>I've been living like I need money to survive. But is that true? If money is a world system, then I’m going to pray about what it means to refrain from participating in it. I’m not talking about racking up credit card debt and stopping paying rent. But living in the truth that God meets all my needs. It sounds like a BIG, crazy idea to talk about rejecting material systems that make us feel comfortable. It’s a big paradigm shift but it’s also amazing how much more of God I’m seeing when I remove kingdoms: mine &amp; the worlds - from my focus.</p> <blockquote> <p>I like all of this. Good and interesting things to think about, if I can ever make time from trying to make it in the world. - Brother, Steve</p> </blockquote> <p>Don’t worry, Steve. all you need to experience are a Death, Losing a business, or health problems to stop trying to make it.</p> <p>Currently feels like The Lord is saying “I know you don’t want to experience death and wouldn’t have signed up for it, but this is the only way (for you Dave &amp; Danae) to learn some big revelations.”. But it's odd that as I've tried to receive what happened below body, and soul, and into my spirit - I’m almost glad that Olivia’s death happend. Life changing ideas about eternity and earth that have come from these undesired experiences.</p> <p>Maybe it’s just my journey I’m explaining but for me, the world has held many comforts I’ve enjoyed. To the point I gladly accept them rather than the risk of leaning solely on God. I think I’m saying that I want to remove the World’s systems from my definition of <em>‘the good life’.</em></p> <div id=disqus_thread></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'wwwoodall';
