His text;</p> <blockquote> <p>looking for something less cutsie and more generic to bring a level of comfort to the fat cats in the finance and ops world.  would love to find something around the ideas of light, shed light on, clarity, clarify, simplify, clean, clear, open, easy. I haven’t come up with anything unique enough to not be taken up in a domain. </p> </blockquote> <p>The key ingredient for people to do business with you is trust. And just like with professional biking where every ounce of weight counts, in new relationships every little ounce of trust counts. </p> <p>The human subconscious has the ability to feel out a situation and know if it's sketchy or not. Companies don't have time to make people think we are not trust-worthy. I believe you can start building trust with your branding and logo. Let me explain how…</p> <h2 id=cohesive>Cohesive</h2> <p>In addition to being a good person, what are the messages people receive before they do business.</p> <p>A name is something that has to fit in many different ways. What does it sound like, look like, and where does it fit in the alphabet. What are ways it could sound bad, and what could people think you said. </p> <p>Then, how will it be displayed? What's the logo? why was that logo picked? </p> <p>Also, my mind goes to a bit of a mash up of letters or numbers. I named my first company AMB3R and have stuck with the 3's for a whlie. Mostly because I saw Ezekiel do it and thought it was a permitted use of the letter 3 as an E.</p> <h2 id=authentic>Authentic</h2> <p>The other thing you have to think about is how authentic is the name to you, the founder. Mike is in Coronado, ca and the theme is allowed to be nautical, navy, and ocean. but me in Boulder, I can't do that or people are going to wonder. Even for a minute. It matters because a new brand needs to look authentic so that in the subconscious people can feel you are authentic. Authentic means there are no surprises and thus, I can give you a little more of my trust. If you shoot stright with your branding, then I think you'll shoot straight with me.</p> <h2 id=inspiring>Inspiring</h2> <p>When your brand inspires people, it makes them feel good. It's like an endorphin and if you help them get it, then they'll want to do business with you.</p> <p>How nice would it be to receive a letter that feels like it's coming from the sea. I imagine receiving a letter in boulder that feels like correspondence from the ocean would be pretty sweet.</p> <h2 id=interesting>Interesting</h2> <p>Work is usually tedious, boring, or otherwise uninteresting for the vast majority of people. If you can provide a creative way to communicate then they will enjoy it.</p> <p>I went to bed with these last messages from Mike; </p> <blockquote> <p>I like the generic and symbolism of a Lantern. Would prefer a hipper Lantrn or Rangr but both are taken.</p> </blockquote> <p>The word 'signal' came to mind. I like the way it sounds and looks so I looked it up in the dictionary. </p> <blockquote> <p>A gesture, action, or sound that is used to convey information or instructions, typically by prearrangement between the parties concerned: </p> </blockquote> <p>Feel accurate to the core of what Mike would be hired to do. Then, I looked at signal flags and sure enought, it's locally applicable</p> <p><img alt="" src="../../images/blog/flags.jpg"/></p> <p><img alt="" src="../../images/blog/signal.png"/></p> <p>You will be sending emails, websites, invoices, and other various points of contact. Will those be recognized or lost in the crowd of noise? </p> <h2 id=good-branding-gets-you-more-business>Good branding gets you more business</h2> <p>Nobody starts a music recommendation with 'this is bad but you should buy it.' As soon as you recommend a music album, that album will be tied to you. Same goes with business recommendations. If you want to get recommended then you better make that person look good by looking good yourself. People show off pretty things and you better be pretty.</p> <p>If word of mouth is the majority of business people receive, then think how will other people say your name. Will they be proud to represent you? So, My mind goes to a few different topics when being given this information. A brand has to be interesting, authentic, inspiring, and cohesive. </p> <hr/><div class=intro-text><h2>More from</h2><h3>DRAFT</h3></div><h2><a href="/blog/then-and-now/">then and now</a></h2><p><p>I started learning to code in order to build my own business.
