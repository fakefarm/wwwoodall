I never had that view of programming because the languages at which I started were more about syntax (HTML, CSS, Ruby). </p> <p>While there may still be levels at which you need to be good at math, there are still tons of tasks for web development that don't get into the realm of being good with numbers. </p> <p>Web programming is more like learning a foreign language. Picture that you just got dropped off in France, or Tokyo and millions of people are speaking things you don't understand. Just as that acclimation will take time, so it goes with computers. </p> <h5 id=its-about-hours>It's about hours</h5> <p>There are so many moving parts to do this. It took me 1,000 hours to get my bearings. Those first 1,000 hours were the hardest for me because I didn't have context to measure my progress. Most of that time was recognizing the painful patterns in such a way that I could articulate them to a more experienced programmer to explain to me. And once I saw the solution to the problem that so entangled me, I remembered it forever.</p> <p>I started by going through books like the <a href="//www.railstutorial.org/" target=_blank>Rails Tutorial</a>. I suppose I had logged about 100 hours and realized I needed a more intense approach. I went to <a href="//www.starterleague.com" target=_blank>Starter League</a> and clocked about 600 hours.</p> <p>I assumed attending a school would be sufficient. But unfortunately there were still gaps from what I knew and what the job market required. It was unnerving to finish a program and not be hired out of the gate. It upset a lot of my fellow classmates who felt the same. </p> <p>I didn't know that the number was 1,000 hours at the time. I just knew there was no going back to the old-world. So I asked a mentor of mine if I could squat at his office to continue to be surrounded by developers. There I was able to have access to several great developers who helped me along.</p> <p>I spent another 3 months, about 60 hours a week coding until I got my first job. In hindsight that 1,000 hours was enough to get me through an interview for a junior level position. I am forever grateful to the guys at <a href="//www.factorylabs.com" target=_blank>Factory Labs</a> for giving me a shot!</p> <h4 id=getting-settled>Getting settled</h4> <p>I started programming thinking that I would get in and learn some things then get back into entrepreneurship. But now that I've logged about 3,000 hours I've started to wonder if I am really motivated by business. I think I prefer being paid to solve problems and let other people figure out how to make money :-)</p> <p>Being a programmer means being well paid to work with smart and witty people, solve challenging problems, use top of the line computers in really cool office space and be constantly challenged. It's the first desk job I have ever loved.</p> <p>This road is long and filled with challenges. But the benefits have made this difficult journey worth it. You have to believe that the time you spend will pay off. Because it will.</p> <div id=disqus_thread></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'wwwoodall';
