I intend to provide the reasons and examples. </p> </blockquote> <p>Recent tech news is that google code is shutting down and that repos should move to github. I think coders should think about moving more to github as well. Have you noticed that any job post says they want a link to your <a href="//www.github.com/woodall">github profile</a>? Why do they want that? They want to see how you present yourself. So why are there so many blank profiles? I use to think of github as a second class citizen and I wonder if other people feel the same. Or, is it they just don't know how to use it? Github is such a remarkable tool you should be on it all the time. I just hit a 120 day streak because I've moved nearly everything on there.</p> <h2 id=consolidate>Consolidate</h2> <p>If your code is going to be public facing, then have it run through github.</p> <h2 id=valuable-social-network>Valuable social network</h2> <p>Twitter and facebook are worthless. But with GH, I get to see what you are like in a professional setting. What kinds of problems you like working on when it's up to you. I also see if we'd make a good fit.</p> <h2 id=perception-is-reality>Perception is reality</h2> <p>There was an article that came out in 2012 about being a developer makes you valuable, but knowing how to market makes you dangerous.</p> <p>I look around at so many great developers who have a wasteland for a github profile.</p> <h2 id=creative-backgrounds>Creative backgrounds</h2> <p>As there's a movement of many non-developers becoming developer, than it should mean that many people with non-traditional backgrounds should be able to come up with creative ways to use the tech tools. Things you can do on github with other developers;</p> <ul> <li>project management</li> <li>learning projects</li> <li>ebooks</li> <li>open source</li> <li>presentations</li> <li>game development</li> <li>ideas</li> <li>your blog</li> <li>side projects</li> </ul> <h2 id=hacker-students-need-to-market>hacker students need to market</h2> <p>As a student of starter league, I know what it's like to be a fresh graduate with no experience. As an intern/new developer, you might think employers are hiring you to code. But they're not because you really don't know how to code and they quickly know it. Why they hire you is because of your <em>potential</em>. They see you as someone they think will make it. So, how do you show them? By your efforts and attitude. A public github shows what you think both in code, and organizationally.</p> <h2 id=practice-makes-perfect>Practice makes perfect</h2> <p>The more I use git and github, the more I'm amazed at how incredible a tool it is. when I look at an empty git repo I think a few things. Either they are not coding or they just don't know how to use git, or they must be so busy they can't do anything else. But like anything, the more you use it, the better you get.</p> <h3 id=use-commit-history-as-a-table-of-contents>Use commit history as a table of contents</h3> <p>The best time to record notes is in the moment. As much as you don't want to document what you just learned, you either use it or lose it. Commit history is a great place to put your free form thoughts about the code you're committing.</p> <h3 id=use-prs-to-ask-for-help>Use PR's to ask for help</h3> <p>There are so few people using github that when I have a question, I just mention a friend I know on there and I can get some help. Like so;</p> <h3 id=use-issues-to-track-your-progress>Use issues to track your progress</h3> <p>Keep a mental note of what you need and make the issues there. Your dashboard will keep all those nice and organized there for you.</p> <h2 id=show-your-tinkering-side>Show your tinkering side</h2> <p>As developers, we know that it's a requirement to tinker and play to learn things. But, how can I really know that you're tinkering and playing around if you don't actually post anything? Of course I know you don't know everything, and no body expects you to. People won't think of you as a poor programmer if you are showing your learning process. In fact, they'll be impressed that you are as much a coder as you are. You'll also be able to get some help.</p> <p>Just put the prefix <code>learn-</code> before your project if you're just messing around and worried.</p> <ul> <li>require</li> <li>hashpage</li> <li>clov3r</li> <li>todo list</li> </ul> <h3 id=my-examples>My examples</h3> <h4 id=fakefarm>fakefarm</h4> <p>I put all my toys here.
