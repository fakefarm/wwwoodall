In 2009, I started to realize that the Internet is here to stay. I know it sounds funny. But what I mean is that I knew how to consume it and used it for banking, bills, and movies. But I had no idea how it all worked. 

I looked around and noticed that it had colonized our lives faster than Rome conquered Europe. I like to describe the web as a new country, I call 'InternetLand'.

Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, HTML is the new English. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.

I knew how to consume the web, but I had no idea how it worked. So, in 2012, I sold my old-world business and dove head-first into all things web. That makes my career path one of a graphic designer, turned entrepreneur, turned developer.

I wrestled with the idea that I was behind. That I had missed the boat. But the reality is there is exponentially more demand than supply of talent. The biggest hurdles are personal.

##### Check yourself
I recently had a conversation with a friend who said the reason he switched majors from computers to finance was that he wasn't good at math. I had forgot about that view of programming, where computers are zeros and ones. 

While there may still be levels at which you need to be good at math, there are still tons of tasks for web development that don't get into the realm of being good with numbers. 

I would say programming is more like learning a foreign language. Picture that you just got dropped off in France, or Tokyo and millions of people are saying things you don't understand. Just as that acclimation will take time, so goes with computers. The popular web languages that I use are so far evolved into natural words. But, the trick is to understand the new language

###### Verbs vs. Variables

Just as English uses verbs, nouns, adjectives, and punctuation, so does a computer. But the computer's grammar is different. A computer's grammar is variables, functions, arguments, keywords, and syntax.

Once you learn the basics, you'll start to put together more complete thoughts, just as you would in speaking a new foreign language.

##### 1000 hours
It took me 1,000 hours to get my bearings. There are so many moving parts to do this. Those first 1,000 hours were the hardest because I didn't have context to measure my performance. Most of that time was recognizing the painful patterns in such a way that I could articulate them to a more experienced programmer. 

##### Learning at a hacker school
After I had spent about 100 hours going through books like the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">rails tutorial</a>, I realized I needed more. I went to <a href='http://www.starterleague.com' target="_blank">starter league</a> in Chicago for 3 months.

That helped me ramp up in a safe environment and clock about 600 hours. Still it was not enough.

##### Sweep the streets
I've probably logged about 3,000 hours now since I started. To be honest, had I had a chance to take a management job during the process, I probably would have. There were days when things were so _emotionally_ difficult I didn't think I'd ever figure this out.

But thankfully, I didn't give up and I am not speaking at a
