## Internetland

In 2009, I started to realize that the Internet is here to stay. I know it sounds funny. But what I mean is that I knew how to consume it and used it for banking, bills, and movies. But I had no idea how it all worked. 

I looked around and noticed that it had colonized our lives faster than Rome conquered Europe. I like to describe the web as a new country, I call 'InternetLand'.

Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, HTML is the new English. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.

I knew how to consume the web, but I had no idea how it worked. So, in 2012, I sold my old-world business and dove head-first into all things web. That makes my career path one of a graphic designer, turned entrepreneur, turned developer.

I wrestled with the idea that I was behind. That I had missed the boat. But the reality is there is exponentially more demand than supply of talent. The biggest hurdles are personal.

#### 1000 hours
It took me 1,000 hours to get my bearings. There are so many moving parts to do this. Those first 1,000 hours were the hardest because I didn't have context to measure my performance. Most of that time was recognizing the painful patterns in such a way that I could articulate them to a more experienced programmer. 

##### Learning at a hacker school
After I had spent about 100 hours going through books like the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">rails tutorial</a>, I realized I needed more. I went to <a href='http://www.starterleague.com' target="_blank">starter league</a> in Chicago for 3 months.

That helped me ramp up in a safe environment and clock about 600 hours. Still it was not enough.
