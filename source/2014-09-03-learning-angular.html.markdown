I've been studying Angular on and off for about 12 months now. 
There are seemingly countless resources on the subject. This is not intended to be one, but more to track my own progress of what it took for me to 
lear. d$to learn and I have done some, and some I want to do. I also have a lot of scattered notes on what I'm learning. This page is just a public journal of my progress.

Since I started as a Rails developer, this page should really be titled "A Rails developer learning Angular." 
The other thing, as you might gather from my other posts, I'm still learning JavaScript too.

 I'm a Rails developer first, so you will notice a substantial overlap between the two frameworks.
Lastly, learning Angular is teaching me things about other things including - JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, CSS, and HTML. So, you'll see that stuff mixed in here too until further notice.

#### To Read
Stuff I want to get to

- [angular wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki)

#### Questions

#### Providers
Providers are the engine to make 5 differet Recipes. I was surprised to see the [Angular Documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers) do a good job of expliaing  them.

The list includes
- values
- constants
- factories
- services
- provider

### Promises
Promises are a way to work with Asynchronous data.

#### Consuming
When working with a Promise object, like `$http`, you will work through 3 different methods

##### then()

##### catch()

##### finally()

#### Producing

When producing a promise, you will work with 4 methods. You will return a promise object.

##### defer()

##### resolve()

##### reject()

##### promise()


#### New Angular
- [$httpBackend](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/service/$httpBackend)

#### Video Tutorials

I felt like the first few videos were a bit slow, but it started getting really good with the parts on Services (video 5) and Promises (video 6)
