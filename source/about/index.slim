  p My wife Danae is amazing. We have been married 10 years, but I feel like I am only getting to know her now. We are so different and that's what I love about her. I look to Danae to help me make decisions big and small. We have two lively sons, Oscar and Wells. They are my best friends.

  h4 The Internet
  p In 2009, I started to realize that the Internet is here to stay. I looked around and noticed that it had colonized our lives faster than Rome conquered Europe. I like to describe the web as a new country, I call 'InternetLand'.
  p Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, HTML is the new English. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.
  p I knew how to consume the web, but I had no idea how it worked. So, in 2012, I sold my old-world business and dove head-first into all things web. That makes my career path one of a graphic designer, turned entrepreneur, turned developer.
  p My current focus full-stack web developer. I'm focused on:
