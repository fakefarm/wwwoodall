I have been working on a board game for a few years now. I think it's nearly done. One of my desires is to make it a web based business. I've gone the route of thinking kickstarter or just selling direct via social media. But I'm now coming to the thought that a blog is the way to get the traffic to drive the sales. The blog can be a way to develop an audience of people who would buy the game anyway.

Since I'm coming late to the blogging game I had the benefit of studying what's out there. Taking my analytical approach I can find the top blogs.

I'm thinking of starting a parenting blog with a masculine bent since I'm a male parent. In doing so, I searched for 'top 25 dad blogs' and came up with this list of ones who hit the market.
