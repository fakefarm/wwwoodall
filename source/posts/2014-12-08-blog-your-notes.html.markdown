It seems all the cool kids blog but I didn't get how to do it. How do they find the time to sit and create content or write a post?

I've found that once I had a blog I was excited to write on and didn't feel like it was going to go away, I just decided to let the activities of the become my posts. 

So, I separate my blogging into two categories; Notes that I can see will become a post. Then, other things I have that I want to keep for reference that may or not become a post. Those things are small snippets like shortcuts, links, bible verses, or tips learned during the day.
