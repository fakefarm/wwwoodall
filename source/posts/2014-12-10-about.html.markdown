## Hi, I'm Dave

### Me in Tags
Christian | Husband | Dad | Full Stack Programmer | Graphic Designer | Inventor
Retired Entrepreneur | IPA Connoisseur | Stove top espresso | Boulder, CO

### Me in paragraph form
I'm an INTJ and my introverted nature tends to think I shouldn't be so forward with my thoughts and views. Translate: I go back and forth between merging personal and professional content on the same site. But I like what Peter Drucker says about people...

> You can't have the hand without the body.

And since you're on my site then I assume you'd like to learn something about me. So, if you're curious about deeper matters then you can read my views. I write to process and also start conversations to learn from.

And if those things don't interest you, then I hope you find something else, like my ninja bird doodles.
