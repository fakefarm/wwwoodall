I'm an INTJ and my introverted nature tends to think I shouldn't be so forward with my thoughts and views. Translate: I go back and forth between merging personal and professional content on the same site. But I like what Peter Drucker says about people...

Since you're on my site then I assume you'd like to learn something about me. 

I find that I think of things in 3's. To me a balance life juggles three things; Personal activity, Relational activities, and Responsibilities.

So, if you're curious about deeper matters then you can read my views. I write to process and also start conversations to learn from.  And if those things don't interest you, then I hope you find something else, like my ninja bird doodles.

I've made a few personal sites over the years but I was never satisfied with how they were managed or laid out. But this site has some potential.
