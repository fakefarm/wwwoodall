There are storm clouds on the horizon and [Detroit's discussion of bankruptcy](http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA6TMNC00) is economic thunder.

I don't take all [this article](http://moneymorning.com/ob-article/schiff-us-will-win-currency-war.php?code=118408) as gospel but I think these views have some merit...

_"Despite "phony" signs of an economic recovery, the cancer destroying America stems from a lethal concoction of our $16 trillion federal debt and the Fed's never ending money printing._

_Currently, Bernanke and company is buying $1 trillion of Treasury and mortgage bonds a year. That's about $85 billion per month against a budget deficit that is about the same level._

_According to Schiff, these numbers are unsustainable. And the Fed has no credible "exit strategy"._

_Eventually interest rates will rise... and when they do, Schiff says, stocks will tank and bonds dip to nothing. Massive new tax hikes will be imposed and programs and entitlements will be cut to the bone."_
