[@dottedt](https://twitter.com/DottedT) recently called me a 'man of faith'. I take it as a complement. And I'm not normally one to mince words but that phrase feels a bit short-sighted. 

Obviously Scott used it to describe me as someone who believes in God. But I contend that every single person is a person of faith. It's just a matter of what your faith is in. Here are your options;

- God
- Self
- Church
- Government
- Money
- Karma

You cannot have hope without faith. And few people think of themselves as someone lacking hope.  So, the I ask the question, what is your faith in? Maybe I should have responded to Scott's description of me with "And so are you." :-)
