Top Level Domains (TLD's) are the end of domain names like; `.com` and`.net`. But relatively new development are the [hundreds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#ICANN-era_generic_top-level_domains) of new TLD's that were released. Domains like;

- .surf
- .church
- .bike
- .accounting

Meaning, instead of `www.boulderBikes.com`, you could use `www.boulder.bike`. The idea is that the ending of the domain can help describe the kind of business.

I totally got sucked into a land grab mentality and ended up buying about 10 or so TLD's new domains including `theCatholic.church`. This has to be worth something to the world's biggest church, right?! 

So I wonder how does one go about selling a gem like this. Other than listing them in auction sites, I came up with another idea. What if I create a site called **The TLD official color guide**. It will be a list of TLD's like `.church`, `.life`, `.biz` and some accompanying color. Why is it the official color? Because I say so and nobody else is making a site that says otherwise :-)

Then, at the bottom I can have my list of domains for sell.

Think it could work?

**Others I have for sale**

`TheNew.today` $1,500 <br> _A motivational product?_

`found.deals` $1,500 <br> 

`theNewLife.church` $1,500 <br>

`Longboarder.surf` $2,500 <br> _A classy surf magazine._

`iLove.deals` $2,500 <br> 
_Yeah you do!_

`brand.deals` $2,500 <br>
_Classy and savvy._

`iLove.church` $2,500 <br> _Who doesn't!_

`theNew.church` $2,500 <br> _A hipster church needs this one._
