I totally got sucked into the TLD new domain craze. I ended up buying 10 or so domains, including _TheCatholic.church_

But just how does one go about selling domains? I got to thinking, what if I create the 'TLD official color guide'. It will just be a list of TLD's like .church, .life, .biz and some accompanying color.

Then, at the bottom I can have my list of domains for sell.

Thank it could work?
