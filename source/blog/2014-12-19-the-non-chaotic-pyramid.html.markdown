_DRAFT_

My brother Mike and I were having some laughs over beers when we started talking about tastes. From those 5 tastes, we went to 4 seasons, 3 parts of the being, 2 people, and 1 God. Then we upped it to 12 months and created a personal challenge to do all 12. Here's what we came up with

**1  God** â€ 

**2  people** male female

**3  parts** body soul spirit

**4  seasons** winter summer spring fall

**5  tastes** sweet sour salty bitter umami

**6  questions** who what where when why how

**7  notes** A B C D E F G

**8  planets**

**9  months** gestation

**10 integers** 0123456789

**11 is** (???)

**12 months**
