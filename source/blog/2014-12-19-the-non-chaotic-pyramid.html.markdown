_DRAFT_

My brother Mike and I were having some laughs over beers when we started talking about tastes. From those 5 tastes, we went to 4 seasons, 3 parts of the being, 2 people, and 1 God. Then we upped it to 12 months and created a personal challenge to do all 12. Here's what we came up with

1  God â€ 
2  people Male female
3  parts body soul spirit
4  seasons winter summer spring fall
5  tastes sweet sour salty bitter umami
6  questions who what where when why how
7  notes | A B C D E F G
8  planets
9  months for gestation
10 integers 0123456789
11 is (???)
12 months
