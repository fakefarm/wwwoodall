We went car-camping at the [Great Sand Dunes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davewoodall/sets/72157634034325051/) last week.

My friend Andy thinks car-camping is not really camping because you bring more than you can carry. It's artificially _roughing it_ because you bring the comforts of home into the wilderness.

That started me thinking about house-camping, which is car-camping with more supplies.

If car-camping can prepare me for house-camping, then I wonder if house-camping will prepare me for an unexpected [natural](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227307/Hurricane-Sandy-Misery-2-5-million-STILL-power-days-lawlessness-fear-over.html), or economic hurricane.
