Have you noticed how pasting a link into facebook and twitter adds a layer of nice styling to the link with an image and such? 

That's based on some code put there by meta tags. It's code that is dynamically generated so once you do it, you don't have to do it again. Also, at the time of the writting Twitter acknowledges that people are using a system that is not native to theirs - called open graph and they will fall back to that, so you don't have to duplicate your code.

Twitter has a [getting started guide](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started)

They call their content 'cards'

There's also a cool [card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) so you don't have to spam your current followers
