### Beautiful location
Tucked nicely alongside the Flatirons, it's hard not to sing a song of praise just from driving around town.

### Awesome weather all year
The lack of humidity is incredible and there's more sun here than California. When it snows, it's only around for a few days before it's burned off.

### Outdoor activities
Love the ability to unplug and get the heart rate up with a hike, bike, or snowboard day.

### Ruby on Rails town.
It helps to know the language. If you're building web apps with Rails, then you'll have no trouble finding work!

### Startup scene
[Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/) has put Boulder on the map as one of the top startup towns in the country. How cool is it to be in a small town buzzing with activity.

### Great Meetups & Confs
There are so many ways to connect with people. My personal favorites are [Ruby On Beer](http://www.rubyonbeer.com/.com) and [Boulder Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/boulder_ruby_group/)

### Small town life
If you like small towns, then you can't find a better one than Boulder. I bike to work and live without the anxiety of big city living. Sure, we have to pay for our grocery bags, have more regulation than I care for, and boast a strong homeless population. But hey, this is America!

### Local breweries
So many great breweries within a 20 mile radius. Odell's, New Belgium, Avery, Southern Sun, Upslope, Twisted Pine, and Left Hand to name a few!

### Pearl street
Pearl street is a great combination of artists, musicians, shops, and eats. I love strolling Pearl street, people watching, saying no to petitions, and enjoying the time with friends.
