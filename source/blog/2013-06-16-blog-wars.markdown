# Blog wars

I've tried many of them including; blogger, [Tumblr] , [wordpress] , [octopress] , [squarespace] , [google docs], [backpack] , [evernote]. In that search, I lost the fact that the point is not the technology, but the content.

I've been intersted in in Jekyll for a while but haven't had a chance to check it out until now.

It's true that it's not a beginners blog. You have to be comfortable with command line, ruby, etc. but after getting here, the effort seems worth it.

I just set up this blog in under 10 min doing the following approach:

# Jekyll install

1 follow instructions to install on page.

    ~ $ gem install jekyll
    ~ $ jekyll new my-awesome-site
    ~ $ cd my-awesome-site

# Deploy to heroku

    git clone ::https://github.com/patilchetan/How-To-Deploy-Jekyll-Website-To-Heroku


Step 2 :


    Download and place all the above files except README.md as it is inside my_jekyll_website.
    These are the important files which tells Heroku to treat the app as Rack app and just sets
    it up on Heroku easily.

Step 3 :


    Add this to you _config.yaml file

    exclude:  [ Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, Procfile, vendor, gems]
    This prevents Jekyll's test posts from showing up on your blog.


Step 4 :


    Run following commands :

    jekyll
    heroku create
    git push heroku master

Step 5 :

    Visit your website :

    heroku open

    3 github repo
    4 deploy
