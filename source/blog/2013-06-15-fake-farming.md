Nobody questions a farmer who stores excess in barns. In fact, many of us envy the idea of additional supplies if things got weird. I have friends who want to live on a farm to avoid problems during economic unrest.

I think that is because a farm feels like the only way to be self-sufficient. But the benefits of storing supplies are not exclusive to farmers. You can purchase items in bulk and use your garage as your barn.

Just because you don't grow food doesn't mean you can't store it. Become an artificial farmer and have the best of both worlds.
