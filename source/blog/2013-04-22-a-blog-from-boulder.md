My world is much smaller than I am led to believe. Twitter and all these social sites make me think that what’s happening in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombings) or any place other than Boulder is my world. False.

My world is what and where I can lead and influence. Currently it is 3 people; Danaé, Oscar, and Wells. I am living a life in Boulder and my focus should be on improving the people and events in this community. I want that reality to create a clear heart, head, and home and be able to listen to God’s plan for my life.

Sprouting roots is a new experience for us. We have been in a transient state for nearly all our marriage. Thus, my first moves of settling are to turn off unnecessary noise and distractions which include personal twitter and facebook accounts.

I can’t help but find it humorous that deleting website accounts is worth talking about.
