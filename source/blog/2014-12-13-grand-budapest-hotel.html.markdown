There are two types of people in this world. Those who love Wes Anderson movies and those who don't. I'm one of the people who loves most of them. My favorites in order: Darljeeling Limited, The Life Aquatic, and The Grand Budapest Hotel.

Wes Anderson has the ability to tell two stories at the same time. There are many dimensions to his Charaters and the story he chooses to tell. 

I love wes anderson movies. But this one has gone one step further for me. This one mixes so many great things.

what i love is that we know that the 'book always is better than the movie.' and wes anderson knows this. So if you pay attention to the beginning of the movie, you get the best of both. 

Anderson has done the job of letting you listen to overly dramatic writing about the scenes we get to see in real life. 

things about just listening to a story from the consierge is overlaid with the paragraph of description from the 'book' that would have been substantially more descrictiive.
