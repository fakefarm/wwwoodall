In 2009, I started to realize that the Internet is here to stay. I know it sounds funny. But what I mean is that I knew how to consume it and used it for banking, bills, and movies. But I had no idea how it all worked. 

I looked around and noticed the Internet had colonized our lives faster than Rome conquered Europe. I like to describe the web as a new country, I call 'InternetLand'.

Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, HTML is the new English. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.

So, in 2012, I sold my old-world business and dove head-first into becoming a full time programmer. That makes my career path one of a graphic designer, turned entrepreneur, turned developer.

I wrestled with the thought that I was behind. That I had missed the boat. But the reality is there is exponentially more demand than supply of talent. The biggest hurdles are personal.
