        <h2>Jack of all trades with a Masters some</h2>
        <p>I've spent 20 years building a diversified career. I used to explain it as 'CEO in training' for why I had such a eclectic combination of skills.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Benjamin-Franklin-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486290735" title="Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography">Benjamin Franklin</a> who introduced me to the life of a Renaissance Man. Or, a man of many interests. Specifically, three primary categories and their relationship hold my primary interest. That is corporate production of Art (systems), Business (profit), and Code (execution). My contribution is my ability to translate between the separate, yet essential aspects of a modern day Enterprise.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Artful Systems</h2>
        <h3>Art<br> + Business<br> = Strategy</h3>
        <p>An exciting customer experience must be designed systematically. I take many plays out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1448317932&sr=1-1&keywords=emyth" title="e-myth">e-myth</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Experience-Economy-Theater-Business/dp/0875848192" title="experience economy">experience economy</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1448317872&sr=1-1&keywords=whole+new+mind" title="a whole new mind">a whole new mind</a> to remain competitive in today's marketplace.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Profitable Business</h2>
        <h3>Business<br> + Code<br> = Profit</h3>
        <p>After my first business went insolvent I realized that ignoring accounting and finance in favor of sales and product design was not smart. This is when I decided to take the time and learn how to manage a sustainable business. I received a Masters in Finance andy applied my new education on a second business, which I sold in after four years and nearly $3M in sales with 3 employees. What we build must serve the customer's need to the end they are willing to pay enough that we make a positive net income on the transaction.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Clean Code</h2>
        <h3>Code<br> + Art<br> = Growth</h3>
        <p>In 2007 Code must be presented in such a way that the user experience is so pleasant it creates raving fans who tell their friends about us.</p>

        <h1>Software Engineer <span class='company'>Jan 2014 - Present</span></h2>
        <p class="comment-detail">livingSocial</p>
        <p>I've had the privilege to work on three entirely different teams. I was hired to handle some frontend work since my Rails skills. I was honest that I was really weak in two areas; javascript and TDD. I interviewed with @dhassler and @timschmelmer. Tim gave me a Russ Olsen Design Pattern quiz which, since I read the book, I told him I knew the answer. Had I not read the book, I would have been lost. But those guys were great and helped me learn a ton.</p>
          <h3>Escapes: Retail Vertical</h3>
          <div class='ls-examples'>
          <p>Most of my work was frontend on Rails: HTML, ERB, Partials, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
          <%= image_tag 'escape.png' %>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <h3>Personalization: Data Science & UI</h3>
          <p>This was a very awkward position because it was opperating in Data Science on a Gem. We weren't even in Rails so I had to orient myself with code that had no familiar acheitechutre. ON top of that, Data Sciene use the words <span>test, engine, model</span> in very different ways. As part of this time I founded an Angular Club to try to apply what I was learning from some exploratory work we were doing. I was able to volunteer for Angular because Doug Ramsey called for ANgular's establishment in the LS eco system. That was before the 2.0 debacle. I had also invested about 1,000 hours with @cjgrimes on Angular so I figured I had to know more than the total beginners. That's when I met Eldar, Shauna, and Ian. Those guys are A+ talent and should be treated as such.</p>
          <h1>Urgency</h1>
          <div class='ls-examples'>
            <p>we used this to entice people 10%. Much of my work on this project was in JavasScipt debugging and QA testing.</p>
            <%= image_tag 'urgency.png' %>
          </div>
          <h1>Daily Gem</h1>
          <div class='ls-examples'>
            <p>Yes, we actually hired Robin Leach <%= link_to "for this", "https://vimeo.com/102170193" %>. At the end of the experiment, we realized that people will buy more if the price is cheaper. The experiment was a success.</p>
            <%= link_to image_tag('robin.png'), 'https://vimeo.com/102170193', taget: '_blank' %>
          </div>
          <h1>Save For Later</h1>
          <div class='ls-examples'>
            <p>
              The idea of save for later was to let people browse and save deals for later. It worked well on mobile but didn't translate to Desktop. This is a project that had nobody in the role because the lead Front End developer left. So, I volunteered and was way in over my head. Thanks to @shaun for bailing me out!

          <h3>Internal Tools: Customer Service</h3>
          <div class='ls-examples'>
            <p>Working in a tech company can make one forget that there are actual people being serviced from all the code we write. Working on internal tools, specifically for customer service reps means I get to learn first hand what our customer problems are and attempting to come up with solutions to empower customer service reps with the ability to create happy customer experiences.</p>

          <h3>Volunteer work</h3>
          <%= image_tag 'five_year_plan.png' %>
          <p>In addition to helping with the code base, I was an active member of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Founder, Leader - Angular Club</li>
            <li>Facilitator - Lightning talks</li>
            <li>Author of
              <%= link_to "LivingSocial 2.0 - A vision for the future", "dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13563632/xls_draft.pdf", target: '_blank' %>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
           Working with three different pilots and then speaking with our <i>Business to Consumer</i> customers gave me perspectives on what entices a customer but also how to solve buyer remorse. Some examples of lessons include: Broad understanding of what it takes to work on a massive code base, Increased understanding of micro services, Managing multiple apps at the same time, and a production level design work flows.

        Youth was an amazing experience but had it's downsides like trying to make something of myself and the delusion of self-sufficiency. But time, trials, and failure helped me see that life is to be lived by following God instead of chasing temporal health and wealth.

        Before coding full time, I spent 17 years in small business sales &amp; marketing experience, including 3 turnarounds, founding 2 companies, selling one, and now realize that Art Director was my favorite past job before coding. I'm formally trained with a Masters in Finance. Yes, it's been an adventure!

        I like to describe the web as a new country called <i>InternetLand</i>.  Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, <i>HTML is the new English</i>. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.
