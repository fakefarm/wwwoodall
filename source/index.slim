    h2 About me
    p I'm glad I'm not a kid anymore. Youth was an amazing experience but had it's downsides like trying to make something of myself and the delusion of self sufficiency. But time, trials, and failure helped me see that life is to be lived by following God instead of chasing temporal health and wealth. I love this season of life because I see now that just as Dana√© sustained Courage in her womb, my heavenly Father sustains me in this world.

    h2 The Internet is here to stay
    p I spent 17 years in the apparel industry working nearly every job including: graphic designer, sales rep, account management, art director, and owning two companies.

    p In 2007 I discovered <a href='http://www.basecamp.com' target='_blank'>basecamp</a>. It's simplicity, effectiveness, and business model fascinated me. It was the first web app that made me realize the web did not die when the <i>dot com</i> bubble burst. The Internet was here to stay.

    h2 HTML is the New English
    p I like describe the web as a new country called <i>InternetLand</i>.  Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, <i>HTML is the new English</i>. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.

    p  So, in 2012 I sold my t-shirt company and dove in head-first to become a full stack web developer. My specific focus is Angular, Rails, and Middleman (I call it the ARM stack). I work full time at <a href="http://www.livingsocial.com" target="_blank">LivingSocial</a>.  I spend my free time coding side projects, raising my sons, and trying to be the husband my wonderful wife deserves.
