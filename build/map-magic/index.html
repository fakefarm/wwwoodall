<p>In my quest to learn it, I went to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">mozialla</a> and found the explaination unclear. I started playing around with it to learn it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']
var more_pets = pets.map(function(value){
return value;
})

pets 
=&gt; ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']
more_pets
=&gt; ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']
</code></pre>

<p>Yay, I didn't break anything.</p>

<p>But what did this buy me? Try again with an uppercase.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird'] 
var more_pets = pets.map(function(value){
return value.toUpperCase();
})

pets 
=&gt; ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']
more_pets
=&gt; ["CAT", "DOG", "MOUSE", "BIRD"]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Is that just because I assigned to a new variable, or something else going on?</em></p>

<p>The documentation says <code>map</code>'s callback has use of four arguments</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'mouse', 'bird']

var pets_info = pets.map(function(first, second, third, fourth){
return [first, second, third, fourth] // put into an array 
})

pets_info
=&gt; [Array[4], Array[4] , Array[4] , Array[4]]
pets_info[0]
=&gt; ["cat", 0, Array[4], undefined]
</code></pre>

<p>Oh now it's starting to make sense. For clarity I should change the names of my arguments from; </p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// I didn't know what the args did so I just numbered them
(first, second, third, fourth) 
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// More accurate naming
(value, index, original_array, fourth)  
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, <strong>Back to pets_info[0]</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">pets_info[0] 
=&gt; ["cat", 0, Array[4], undefined] 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="understanding-maps-callback-arguments">Understanding map's callback arguments</h3>

<p>So, Map's callback takes at least 3 arguments.</p>

<h4 id="value">Value</h4>
<p>The first one is the value of the current item being looped over
so, 'cat' in this situation.</p>

<h4 id="original-arrays-index">Original Array's index</h4>
<p>Next, you are given the array index</p>

<h4 id="the-original-array">The Original Array</h4>
<p>You can get the entire array back if desired. I can see that to be pretty handy.  Maybe something like checking the previous or next value of the array could influence how you interact with the current value.</p>

<h4 id="this-the-fourth">This? (The fourth)</h4>
<p>It seems like the API is telling me that the fourth argument is <code>this</code> but I am not finding a good use for it. </p>

<h2 id="what-is-magic">What is magic?</h2>
<p>I am new enough to programming that I am still trying to decipher what's magic and what's my responsibility. If you're still reading, chances are you're on the junior side too. <em>Developers who know about <code>map()</code> have long since moved on to .gif hunting.</em></p>

<p><img alt="flying gif" src="http://img.ffffound.com/static-data/assets/6/16d2cae8eab49c134dbf0eda6aed315dc4d50d87_m.gif" /></p>

<p>After learning about <code>map</code> I had an AH-HA moment about programming in general. </p>

<p>In the past, I would get tripped up when pairing with an experienced developers who took educated guesses at the way the function <strong>should</strong> work and got it right. That gave me the impression I had missed out on some fundamental concepts about how <strong>functions</strong> worked. </p>

<p>My Ah-ha moment was realizing that a function's arguments have to be designed and used in a specific way. You can only know what that order is if you wrote it, take an educated gues, or read the documentation. I realized that nobody innately knows how other people's code works. </p>

<h3 id="expectations-at-work">Expectations at work</h3>

<p>Knowing that a function is designed all they way through gives me confidence that when I have to use someone else's function, then I should be able to mimic it's existing pattern for my own use. </p>

<p>It's also not unreasonable to expect that a co-worker will document their methods somehow be it;
tests, api, proper naming, or comments.</p>

<p>So the same goes for me. I should write code with an awareness that other devs are going to use it and I had better do a good job of clearly communicating how it works.</p>
