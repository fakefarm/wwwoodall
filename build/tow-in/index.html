If they have a passion, they want to spend that precious time doing that passion.</p><h2>Reason 2:  Other dads can be real dull.</h2><p>Dads would rather do their passion solo, than spend time with a bunch of dull dads. I have trouble with prolonged chit-chat. When we have a community outing, I am thinking ofthe guys who will be there that I can talk about something exciting.  I think this is where beer is becoming so popular, because it helps numb the dullness. People without passion are dull.</p><p>I've succeeded if my goal was to depress you. But, there are actually two reasons Dads should try to find friends.</p><p>I'll give you two reasons why it's worth it to make friends in your 30's.</p></div><div class="post-copy"><h2>Tip 1: Don't think you're more macho than Laird.</h2><p>Have you ever heard of laird hamilton? He's a world class surfer who surfs 100' waves. The guy is a monster machine. But you know what? He's not fast enough to catch those waves on his own. He needs someone on a jetski to tow him into the wave. Macho Laird needs someone in order that he can fulfill his passion.</p><p>Laird hamilton lives his passion because he asks for help.</p><p>Laird's passion is a difficutl one for him.</p><div class="click-me">Read about Laird.</div></div><div class="post-copy"><h2>What is difficult for you?</h2><p>The word _difficult_ is relative to everyone. What's difficult for one man is not difficult for another.</p><h3>Camping is difficult for me.</h3><p>Camping is hard for me to do. The planning. The equipment. The location. There are so many little details that I have never had the time or money to acquire. Camping is difficult for me, so I asked for help.</p><p>It's something that I can get excited about because it's new and different and I can follow an expert.</p><p>Jeff towed me into the wave I couldn't do on my own. In the process, we've become good friends.</p><p>To learn to camp. And Jeff had a passion to share camping. We were able to bond in such a way we've become friends.</p><div id="jeff"><div id="jeff-intro"><div class="copy"><h1>This is Jeff.</h1><h2>He's a man's man.</h2><h3>- Former Forrest Ranger</h3><h3>- Works for Boulder, County.</h3><h3>- Climbed all of Colorado's 14'ers</h3><h4>Even has the cousy to<a href="#"> prove it</a>.</h4><div class="jeff-fishing"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="post-copy"><h2>Tip 2: Share your passion.</h2><p>I love to program. I'm more than happy to help and talk with anyone who wants to learn. On the very rare occasion someone does ask, I break my routine and help them. Why? Because it's a passion of mine. I get a thrill in seeing people migrate to Internetland. If you can't believe passion is self-gratifying, then consider it my calling.</p><p>Men who have passions, glady share them. Point one (time strapped) means that even passionate dads don't get to do what they love as often as they like.</p><p>So, when Jeff Mr camping hears I need help, he gladly offers it. Jeff was more than happy to share camping with me. So, it was a safe ask for me to ask him about camping.</p></div><div class="post-copy"><h2>What is your passion?</h2><p>But, this brings up a good point. If you want to ask, then you have to possess a passion for something.</p><p>A sub-point to this post is that Most dads don't have a wave, a passion, to ask for help about. Let me be more blunt;</p><ul><li>What are you doing about it?</li><li>What do you want to be?</li><li>Who can you ask help for?</li><li>If you don't know, what are you doing to find those people?</li></ul></div><div class="post-copy"><div class="poem"><h2>How to become friends in your 30's.
