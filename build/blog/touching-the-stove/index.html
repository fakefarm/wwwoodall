I want to burn my hand on something relatively harmless. I've rebuilt this site at least 3 times because of I didn't incorporate some fundamentals in earlier versions.</p> <h2 id=the-files-were-not-properly-organized>The files were not properly organized.</h2> <p>Things became harder to change after only a few days into the project. That's the first smell. If I have trouble knowing where and how content is organized now, two weeks from now I won't have any idea how this site works.</p> <p>I've had that happen where I take a break from a project and 2 weeks later I have forgotten most of what I did. I'm going to question my own thought process and notes. So the first few times I built the site, I built it for the external use. I wanted to see my vision look good.</p> <p>Once I achieve that, I wanted to make some changes. So in adding content to my blog I found use to be a bit clunky. </p> <p>So, my latest iteration is to organize the code in such a way that it makes sense for my future self.</p> <h3 id=lesson-1-keep-files-organized>Lesson 1: Keep files organized.</h3> <h2 id=i-duplicated-code>I duplicated code.</h2> <p>Nothing creates code fatigue quickler than having to repeat my efforts more than once. While building the the site, I couldn't tell if and when I needed something again. But soon I found myself repeating code a third and even fourth time. What you want to do is fix it once and it works everywhere. </p> <h3 id=lesson-learned-practice-dry-dont-repeat-yourself-or-you-will-cry>Lesson learned: Practice DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) or you will cry.</h3> <h2 id=i-named-things-poorly>I named things poorly.</h2> <p>This is another version of removing duplication. Much of my duplication was due to my naming essentially identical pieces of code, differently. Once I saw the pattern what I needed to do was abstract the naming to something more common. That made it easier to reuse code and remove duplication. win/win</p> <h3 id=lesson-2-name-things-as-generic-as-possible>Lesson 2: Name things as generic as possible.</h3> <h2 id=pages-didnt-match>Pages didn't match</h2> <p>One of the consequences of sloppy code is inconsistency. Headers are too big or too small and there are little hacks all around the stylesheets to adjust. These only make for future fatigue. </p> <h3 id=lesson-3-sloppy-code-makes-pages-inconsistent>Lesson 3: Sloppy code makes pages inconsistent.</h3> <h2 id=users-dont-like-me-as-much-as-i-like-myself>Users don't like me as much as I like myself</h2> <p>My first version had a really cool bird I designed. I was proud of it and thought it made for a cool landing page. But I've realized that landing pages are not user-friendly. The clock starts when I land on your page and you've got <em>millaseconds</em> to convince me to stay and click something else. </p> <p>You have to keep a vieweres interest level or they will leave. So when it comes to my obscure blog, I need to make sure my content is easy to read, find, scan, and navigate. That means I should put the new, best stuff up to the front with fewest clicks possible.</p> <h3 id=lesson-4-make-the-site-user-friendly>Lesson 4: Make the site User Friendly.</h3> <p>The content on my site was buried. So I completly removed the page and opted for a timeline format. That way you can see the latest content and determine if it's worth clicking further. And since I go to the trouble of adding content, I hope that you find something you want.</p> <h2 id=bad-data-is-a-pain-in-the-neck>Bad data is a pain in the neck.</h2> <p>I've started listing out links and books I've read. This yaml lists are a couple thousand lines of code. When I ported them over I had some syntax issues with my data. It was at that moment I see why the Database guys are so protective of what goes into their systems. Trying to find those syntax errors on my small scale was a big pain. I can only image what it's like for real systems.</p> <h3 id=lesson-5-dont-be-casual-about-data-storage>Lesson 5: Don't be casual about data storage.</h3> <h3 id=takeaway>Takeaway</h3> <p>These are fundamentals I needed to know as a developer. I had a sense that these are the kind of topics you learn by not adhering to them. These are things to think about when it comes to estimating a project. If you plan to actually use the software you write, then you will need to take the time to make it right.</p> <hr/><div class=intro-text><h2>More from</h2><h3>Learning to Code</h3></div><h2><a href="/blog/mockup-and-models/">Mockup and models</a></h2><p><p>This is the second post about my learning project; an app for ideas. <a href="/blog/idea-for-ideas">Read the backstory</a>.</p> <p>Below is mockups for the Idea page.
